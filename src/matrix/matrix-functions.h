/** The function ComplexFft does an Fft on the vector argument v.
   v is a vector of even dimension, interpreted for both input
   and output as a vector of complex numbers i.e.
   \f[ v = ( re_0, im_0, re_1, im_1, ... )    \f]

   If "forward == true" this routine does the Discrete Fourier Transform
   (DFT), i.e.:
   \f[   vout[m] \leftarrow \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} vin[i] exp( -2pi m n / N )  \f]

   If "backward" it does the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)
   *WITHOUT THE FACTOR 1/N*,
   i.e.:
   \f[   vout[m] <-- \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} vin[i] exp(  2pi m n / N )   \f]
   [note the sign difference on the 2 pi for the backward one.]

   Note that this is the definition of the FT given in most texts, but
   it differs from the Numerical Recipes version in which the forward
   and backward algorithms are flipped.

   Note that you would have to multiply by 1/N after the IDFT to get
   back to where you started from.  We don't do this because
   in some contexts, the transform is made symmetric by multiplying
   by sqrt(N) in both passes.   The user can do this by themselves.

   See also SplitRadixComplexFft, declared in srfft.h, which is more efficient
   but only works if the length of the input is a power of 2.

/*
   This class allows you to compute the class of function described in
    http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2018_svd_derivative.pdf
   and to backprop through that computation.
   Short summary: it allows you to apply some kind of scalar function
   to the singular values of a matrix, reconstruct it, and then backprop
   through that operation.

   This class is quite general-purpose in the sense that you can
   provide any scalar function; but in order to avoid things like
   passing function-pointers around, we had give it a rather clunky
   interface.  The way you are supposed to use it is as follows
   (to give an example):

      Matrix<BaseFloat> A(...);  // set it somehow.
      SvdRescaler rescaler(A);
      const VectorBase<BaseFloat> &lambda_in = A.InputSingularValues();
      VectorBase<BaseFloat> &lambda_out = *(A.OutputSingularValues());
      VectorBase<BaseFloat> &lambda_out_deriv = *(A.OutputSingularValueDerivs());
      for (int32 i = 0; i < lambda_in.size(); i++) {
        // compute the scalar function and its derivative for the singular
        // values.
        lambda_out(i) = some_func(lambda_in(i));
        lambda_out_deriv(i) = some_func_deriv(lambda_in(i));
      }
      Matrix<BaseFloat> B(A.NumRows(), A.NumCols(), kUndefined);
      rescaler.GetOutput(&B);
      // Do something with B.
      Matrix<BaseFloat> B_deriv(...);  // Get the derivative w.r.t. B
                                       // somehow.
      Matrix<BaseFloat> A_deriv(A.NumRows(), A.NumCols());  // Get the derivative w.r.t. A.


 */

 public:
  /*
    Constructor.
    'A' is the input matrix.  See class-level documentation above for
     more information.

    If 'symmetric' is set to true, then the user is asserting that A is
    symmetric, and that that symmetric structure needs to be preserved in the
    output.  In this case, we use code for the symmetric eigenvalue problem to
    do the decomposition instead of the SVD.  I.e. decompose A = P diag(s) P^T
    instead of A = U diag(s) V^T, using SpMatrix::Eig().  You can view this as a
    special case of SVD.

  // constructor.  The reason why this is not const is that there may be
  // situations where you discover that the input matrix has some very small
  // singular values, and you want to (say) floor them somehow and reconstruct,
  // and have the derivatives be valid assuming you had given that 'repaired'
  // matrix A as input.  Modifying the elements of this vector gives you
  // a way to do that, although currently this class doesn't provide a way
  // for you to access that 'fixed-up' A directly.
